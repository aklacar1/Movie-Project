This is draft project, and as such it is not finished. Things that need to be changed in this project :
1. Exception Handler is needed, preferably custom with database inserts. Error Handler on frontend also needed to notify in case of failed operations.
2. Method logging is needed for C,U and D operations, esspecially "D"
3. Soft Delete should be implemented
4. Further Database optimization is needed : Genre and Movies should have one more table Called GenreMovies that would connect these two
5. Further decoupling on Server and Client side is needed, on server side Microservice Architecture would be more beneficial
6. Single Sign On would be prefered option with Token Authentification
7. All Microservices should be decoupled into separate projects for easier maintanence.
8. On FrontEnd switch to Angular instead of AngularJS would be prefered option and further optimization needed.
9. Finishing controllers both frontend and backend
10. Data validation and verification needed on entire project.
11. Front end needs review of files, HTML should only have HTML, rest should be in separate CSS and JS files.
12. Resource optimisation needed, not all resources included are used.
13. Change Insert Methods so that they insert only the main object and not its sub elements. Or find alternative.
14. Implement Rating with Angular Star Rating and limit it per account.
